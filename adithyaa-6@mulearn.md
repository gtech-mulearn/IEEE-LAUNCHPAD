### About Me
Hello! My name is Adithya A, and I’m someone who’s passionate about learning, creating, and growing through new experiences. I am currently pursuing a btech degree in IT at GECI completing my 2nd sem this month. I’ve developed a strong foundation in C, Python, HTML, CSS, and some of JS throughout my first yreat of college and I’m always eager to expand my knowledge.

Outside of my college, I really enjoy learning things by my own through youtube tutorials, I like spending my time on my laptop learning and coding, I also enjoy music, drawing,... These hobbies keep me balanced and inspired, and they often influence how I approach challenges creatively.
