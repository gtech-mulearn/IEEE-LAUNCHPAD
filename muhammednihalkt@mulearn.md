# Muhammed Nihal K T

Hello, tech visionaries! 👋  
I’m **Muhammed Nihal K T**, a passionate and curious technology enthusiast from **Kerala, India**. Ever since I got introduced to the world of computing, I’ve been fascinated by how technology can solve real-world problems and bring innovative ideas to life. Over the past couple of years, I’ve immersed myself in a variety of tech domains, constantly learning, building, and challenging myself to grow.

My journey in tech began with tinkering around with simple circuits and writing my first few lines of code. That small spark turned into a full-blown passion, and since then, I’ve worked on numerous projects—ranging from **web-based applications** to **IoT devices using Arduino**, and even diving deep into **cybersecurity and ethical hacking** labs to understand the darker corners of the internet.

What drives me is the thrill of creation and problem-solving. Whether it’s building a **smart dustbin with automatic door control**, developing a **Tic-Tac-Toe game from scratch**, or understanding how to bypass XSS filters in web apps as part of a security challenge, I find joy in both the journey and the results.

🛠️ **Current Skills & Interests**:
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, C
- **Web**: HTML, CSS, React.js, Node.js
- **Cybersecurity**: XSS, DVWA, TryHackMe Labs
- **Embedded Systems**: Arduino, Sensors, Servos
- **Tools**: Git & GitHub, Linux, Canva, Figma, ChatGPT, Gamma

💡 **Projects I've Worked On Recently**:
- Smart Dustbin with Ultrasonic Sensor and Servo Motor
- Full-stack Timestamp Microservice using Node.js
- Tic-Tac-Toe Game with HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- DVWA Vulnerability Report with LaTeX-Generated PDF
- GitHub Book App Enablement Task (Fork, Branch, PR)
- React Portfolio Static Site

🚀 **Why IEEE Launchpad 2025?**  
I see IEEE Launchpad as a powerful platform to connect with like-minded peers, showcase my skills, and learn from the best minds in the industry. I believe in growing through community collaboration, and I’m here to make the most of every opportunity—whether it’s through hackathons, team projects, or workshops. I aim to learn, share, and evolve throughout this journey.

🌱 **Currently Learning**: 
- Advanced Git Workflows  
- Secure Web App Development  
- LaTeX for technical documentation  
- Express.js and MongoDB  
- Low-level Linux Exploits  

🎯 **Goals for 2025**:
- Contribute to at least 3 open-source projects
- Build a full-fledged portfolio site with blog and project pages
- Earn cybersecurity certifications (like CompTIA or CEH)
- Participate in CTF competitions and real-world hack challenges

Let’s connect, collaborate, and create something meaningful together. Here’s to learning, building, and pushing boundaries 🚀
