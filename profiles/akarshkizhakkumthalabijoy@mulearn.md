| **Vehicle Management System**  | This is a Python-based project that allows users to manage vehicle-related details efficiently. Users can check their vehicle's pollution test status, pay fines, and pay taxes after logging in. The admin has additional privileges, including adding new vehicle records, deleting data, imposing fines/taxes, and verifying pollution test results. Both users and admins must authenticate through a login system to access their respective features. This project ensures seamless vehicle data management and compliance tracking.                                              | [Hosted Link 1](https://example.com)    | [Repo Link 1](https://github.com/username/project1)             |
| **Flood Prediction ML Model**  | This Flood Prediction ML Model is built using a Decision Tree Classifier and trained on a dataset from Kaggle. The model achieves an 82% accuracy score in predicting flood-related patterns. While it does not precisely predict flood years, it demonstrates strong potential for improvement with further refinement and dataset enhancements. This project serves as a foundation for future flood prediction models, aiding in disaster preparedness and risk assessment.                                              | [Hosted Link 2](https://example.com)    | [Repo Link 2](https://github.com/username/project2)             |

#### Leadership and Influence:

- I enjoy taking the lead in projects and developing practical tech solutions. I have built a Flood Prediction ML Model with 82% accuracy and a Vehicle Management System that streamlines fines, taxes, and pollution test management. Currently, I am leading a fire alarm project, overseeing its development from planning to execution. Beyond my projects, I actively support my peers, helping them debug code and understand ML concepts. I also focus on clear communication, ensuring my work is well-documented and effectively shared.

#### Networking:

- I actively engage with the tech community through collaborations, discussions, and knowledge sharing. I participate in hackathons, open-source projects, and tech forums to connect with individuals. By documenting my projects and giving presentations, I aim to make complex concepts more accessible. As a leader, I guide and support my peers, especially in projects like ML models. I believe in teamwork, and continuous learning, using clear communication and collaboration to influence and inspire others, fostering a strong and innovative tech community.

#### Career Plan:

- I plan to enhance my skills, collaborate on real-world projects, and engage with Keralaâ€™s startup community. In the long run, I aim to develop scalable software, contribute to open-source projects, and mentor aspiring developers, helping build a stronger tech ecosystem.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala can grow its tech startup ecosystem by supporting innovation, skill development, and industry collaboration. Providing better funding, mentorship, and startup-friendly policies will help new businesses thrive. Focusing on AI, automation, and global networking can make Kerala a leading technology center.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

- I contribute to open-source by building projects like a Vehicle Management System and a Flood Prediction ML Model, focusing on efficiency and accessibility. I also help with debugging, optimization, and documentation. Moving forward, I aim to contribute to larger projects in AI, automation, and system development to enhance my skills and support the community.

#### History of Community Engagement:

- I stay connected with the tech community by exploring forums, GitHub, and discussions to learn and solve problems. While I focus on building projects, I aim to actively contribute by sharing knowledge and helping others in the future.

#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

- I havenâ€™t created technical blogs or videos yet, but I plan to share my knowledge through blog posts, tutorials, or project documentation in the future. My focus will be on software development, AI, and automation, making complex topics easier to understand for others in the tech community.

#### Highly Used Software Tools:

- - Visual Studio Code
  - Google Collab
  - IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment)
  - PyCharm

#### Competitive Website Profiles:
