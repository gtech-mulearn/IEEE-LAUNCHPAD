### About Me

> Hello! I’m a 19-year-old girl from Kozhikode, Kerala. I am currently pursuing my B.Tech degree in Information Technology at Government Engineering College Idukki and I’m in my second year now. Ever since I started my journey in engineering, I’ve been deeply enthusiastic about coding and exploring the world of technology.

I love learning new things on my own — in fact, I’ve already taught myself the basics of web development and even picked up some ethical hacking skills out of pure curiosity. I believe that constant self-learning is what keeps this field exciting and keeps me motivated to grow every day.

Apart from my academics, I always like to keep myself busy with something productive. I really enjoy spending time on my laptop, whether it’s working on small projects, experimenting with technical stuff, or simply learning something new online. My hobbies include drawing, which lets me express my creativity in a different way, and it balances out my technical side perfectly.

I also love taking part in hackathons because they challenge me to solve real-world problems and push my limits as a developer. I enjoy working in teams, brainstorming ideas, and bringing them to life through code.

In the future, I hope to keep learning more advanced skills and grow into a confident and capable tech professional. I’m excited to see where my passion for coding, my eagerness to learn, and my love for staying engaged will take me next!
