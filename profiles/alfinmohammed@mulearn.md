### About Me

> I am a hardware and software enthusiast, passionate about DIY projects in electronics and IoT. My focus is on integrating hardware with software for practical and innovative solutions. One of my notable creations is a space mouse, which I designed and 3D printed to suit my specific needs for Fusion 360 projects. I'm also experienced in working with microcontrollers like Arduino, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi. I have developed and implemented a wide range of projects, including an IoT-based pet feeder, a fingerprint door lock system, and a fully 3D-printed hollow clock. I enjoy solving real-world problems through technology, and I am continuously exploring new ways to combine hardware and software to improve people's lives.

#### Leadership and Influence:

- I have demonstrated leadership through roles such as the technical coordinator for the college fest "Ithiha" and as a mentor for workshops on IoT, AI, and microcontroller development. I was also the head of a technical game show called "Crack the Code" at my college. Additionally, I co-founded a tech startup, Alphatech Enterprises, where I contribute to the direction and growth of the company. I am actively involved in empowering youth by sharing my knowledge through mentoring and hands-on projects.

#### Networking:

- I have developed a strong network within the tech community, especially through my involvement in events like the IEEE Young Engineering Students Summit, Startup Conclave at Kerala Financial Corporation, and Innovation Design Entrepreneurship Bootcamps organized by AICTE. I plan to engage further with the community by attending more conferences, workshops, and meetups, and by sharing knowledge through blogs and tutorials.

#### Career Plan:

- My immediate goal is to uplift my startup, Alphatech Enterprises, to a new level and create job opportunities in Kerala. Long-term, I plan to develop sustainable solutions that address everyday challenges faced by people across India. By focusing on innovation and leveraging technology, I hope to contribute to both the local and national ecosystem.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala has immense potential to excel in the tech ecosystem, especially if there is greater investment in infrastructure and the youth. By improving government approval processes, training a skilled workforce, and promoting manufacturing and R&D, Kerala can become a leader in tech innovation. Attracting investors and fostering a supportive environment for startups will drive growth in the state's tech sector.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

- While I haven't contributed directly to widely known open-source projects, I have worked on my own projects and shared them on platforms like GitHub, making them accessible to others. I aim to continue contributing to open-source projects, especially in areas like IoT, AI, and microcontroller programming.

#### History of Community Engagement:

- I have been actively engaged in the community through mentoring, workshops, and volunteering. I served as the student head of the AICTE IDEA Lab, where I mentored students in the fields of AI, IoT, and microcontroller development. I have also contributed to technical forums and platforms like Stack Overflow, where I assist fellow developers with technical queries.

#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

- I have written a blog post on Medium detailing my experience building an IoT pet feeder using ESP8266, Senric Pro, and SG90 Servo Motor, which has gained attention among DIY electronics enthusiasts. I also share my work and projects on GitHub, providing resources for others to build upon.

#### Highly Used Software Tools:

- I have worked on tools like the MVP medical bot for diabetic patients, which has the potential to scale and benefit a wider audience. Although not yet widely used, I am focusing on refining the bot to be accessible for more people with health conditions.

#### Competitive Website Profiles:

- I currently do not have profiles on competitive websites like Exercism, HackerRank, Kaggle, or others.
