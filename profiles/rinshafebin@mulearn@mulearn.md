# RINSHA FEBIN 

### PYTHON DJANGO WEB DEVELOPER

With a solid foundation in **Computer Engineering**, earned through a completed **Diploma**, and enriched by an intensive internship focused on **Python**, **Django** . I am passionate about building scalable, user-friendly web applications and solving real-world problems through code.

Currently working as a **Python Full Stack Developer Intern** at Bridgeon Solutions, I have hands-on experience developing full-stack applications â€” including an eCommerce platform with **JWT authentication**, a modern **React-based UI**, and **Tailwind CSS** design system.

I aim to transition into an **entry-level developer role** where I can contribute meaningfully to innovative projects, collaborate with skilled teams, and continue sharpening my skills in a dynamic tech environment.

Driven by curiosity and a growth mindset, I am always eager to learn, explore new technologies, and make a positive impact through my work.

I have studied and worked with a full-stack tech stack including:

- **Python**, **Django**, **Django REST Framework (DRF)**
- **JavaScript**, **React.js**, **Redux**
- **HTML**, **CSS**, **Tailwind CSS**
- **SQL** and **Django ORM** for database management
