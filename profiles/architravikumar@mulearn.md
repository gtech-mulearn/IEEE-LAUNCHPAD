#### Highly Used Software Tools:

- Figma is one of the most powerful tools I've used in my design workflow, which is a cloud-based design tool that enables users to collaborate on projects in real-time. Figma has also become an integral part of my design toolbox, and the collaborative aspects are why it is so commonly used with teams that are working on large and complex design-oriented tasks. Since many designers, prototypers, and system designers can collaborate within the same tool, I have collectively designed systems that enhance user experience in both functionality and, in many cases, visual design for its end-users in various domains.
