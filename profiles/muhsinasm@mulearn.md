#### Leadership and Influence:
As I am in the early stages of my technical career, I am currently focusing on learning and building my skills. While I haven’t yet held formal leadership positions, I actively engage with my peers by sharing useful resources, motivating them to join technical bootcamps, and learning together in study groups. I believe leadership is not just about positions but also about helping others grow, and I am steadily building my leadership through community participation and project collaboration.

#### Networking:
I have been building my professional network by actively participating in online learning platforms like LinkedIn Learning, Forage, TryHackMe, and Hackerrank. I connect with like-minded learners, share progress on my LinkedIn profile, attend online bootcamps, workshops to expand my network and engage with technical discussions on platforms like GeeksforGeeks. Moving forward, I aim to attend local Kerala-based tech events and join active technical communities like μLearn to grow my network further and collaborate on meaningful projects.  

#### Career Plan:
Immediate Plan:
Continue strengthening my technical foundation by completing practical cybersecurity labs on TryHackMe, competitive programming on HackerRank, and networking tasks through Cisco Packet Tracer. I plan to start contributing to beginner-friendly open-source projects and share my learning journey.

Long-term Plan:
My goal is to contribute actively to Kerala’s startup ecosystem by supporting new technology initiatives, participating in hackathons, and collaborating with students to build innovative solutions. Eventually, I plan to build or join a startup focusing on solving real-world challenges using technology.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:
Kerala has immense potential to grow as a startup hub, especially with talented students and good digital infrastructure. To make the ecosystem stronger, there should be more student-centric startup events, mentorship programs, and collaboration between educational institutions and startup companies. Focus on emerging technologies like cybersecurity, AI, and IoT can position Kerala as a national leader in tech innovation.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:
I am still in the early stages of my open-source journey. While I haven’t yet contributed to major projects, I have been exploring beginner-friendly GitHub repositories, learning how open-source collaboration works, and preparing to contribute to web and cybersecurity-related projects soon.

#### History of Community Engagement:
I have actively participated in technical bootcamps organized by DevTown, LinkedIn Learning, and μLearn. I regularly engage with technical content on platforms like GeeksforGeeks and have completed tasks and projects on Cisco Packet Tracer. Although I am still early in community engagement, I plan to start contributing more in discussion forums and technical Discord servers.

#### Highly Visible Technical Content:
As of now, I’ve shared parts of my learning experience through LinkedIn posts related to cybersecurity, Cisco Packet Tracer projects, and online course completions. In the near future, I plan to write blog posts on platforms like Medium or Hashnode to share my experiences with learning cybersecurity, networking, and programming.
