I’ve organized multiple tech and innovation sessions and guided peers in using platforms like LinkedIn, GitHub, and Google Cloud. I’ve mentored juniors during onboarding events and led content initiatives.

#### Networking:

- I regularly participate in events like µLearn CETKR, IEDC meetups, and online communities. I actively build connections on LinkedIn and Discord to learn, share, and uplift fellow tech learners. I plan to connect Kerala tech youth across districts via collaborative project challenges.

#### Career Plan:

- Short-term: Enhance my skills in full-stack development and participate in national innovation challenges.
- Long-term: Launch socially impactful tech products from Kerala and support India's digital infrastructure mission.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala’s strength lies in its talent and literacy. By focusing on early exposure to product building, funding rural tech cells, and industry-institute linkups, Kerala can become the Silicon Valley of India.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

- I’ve contributed to open-source web projects like µLearn websites and internal campus tools. Plan to engage in more contributions via Hacktoberfest and GSSoC in the coming months.

#### History of Community Engagement:

- Volunteered in organizing µLearn sessions, created beginner GitHub guidance, and moderated tech discussions. IEDC CETKR’s Discord also features content I curated.

#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

- Working on a blog series titled "Tech4Bharat" aimed at showcasing rural-focused software ideas and infrastructure tools (to be published on Hashnode soon).

#### Highly Used Software Tools:

- Developed a basic attendance management system used by our campus team.
- Built a reusable event poster generator in Python for campus event coordination.
