### About Me

> I'm a Linux user who became a programmer by writing shell scripts. I am currently learning web development, UI/UX design, and Lua. I love configuring my developer environment to have the least amount of friction. What interests me the most are the challenges and the problem-solving associated with them.

#### Networking:
Going out and reaching out is something I've been doing lately since I understood the fact that trying out new things and meeting new people is one of the simplest yet most influential things one could do in order to advance in their career as well as in life. Going forward, I'll be attending events like Launchpad to widen my network as well as my knowledge.

#### Career Plan:

- My short-term plan is to learn more languages, become better at the ones I currently know, and attend as many events like these as I humanly can in order to meet new people and present myself to the world.
- The long-term goal would be to join a reputed company and advance my career as a software developer and UI/UX designer.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- The growth that Kerala's tech ecosystem has seen in the last few years is very commendable. Especially after COVID, when everyone thought the graph would go down, it has only been growing so far. I'm thrilled to finally be part of this ecosystem and raise it to the world's top standards.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

- I created my Github account in June of last year. The 24th of next month marks its one-year anniversary. Up until now, I have contributed by code and by other means, like reporting bugs, to numerous projects here. Some of them are:
  - Creation of [Oneclick Website Deployer](https://github.com/shreyas-a-s/oneclick-website-deployer), which is under-the-hood a collection of bash scripts. But going through it allows anybody who is into the creation of shell scripts to learn at least one new thing about bash scripts.
  - Creation of [Linux Tweaks](https://github.com/shreyas-a-s/linux-tweaks), which incorporates a multitude of ways by which one can personalize their Linux desktop or laptop experience into something that is very enjoyable and pretty to look at.
  - Contributed code to projects like [tokyodark.nvim](https://github.com/tiagovla/tokyodark.nvim/).
  - Contributed by reporting issues to multiple projects.
