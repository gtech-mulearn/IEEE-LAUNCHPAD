### About Me

I’m a curious and creative Computer Science and Engineering student at St. Joseph’s College of Engineering and Technology, passionate about technology, UI/UX, and full-stack web development. I enjoy transforming ideas into functional and aesthetic digital experiences. My journey includes building responsive web apps, crafting beautiful frontends in React, and experimenting with AI/ML tools to explore smarter solutions.

I’ve worked on projects like a CLI-based password manager, interactive web tools using Client-side Web APIs, and creative UI ideas like a cat-themed quiz. I constantly seek to upskill through hands-on learning, GitHub projects, and participating in hackathons and workshops.

Beyond code, I’m driven by clean design, meaningful user experience, and real-world impact. I’m looking for internship opportunities where I can grow as a developer and contribute to problem-solving in modern tech ecosystems.
