# Bibin Vincent 

### About Me

> I am a passionate and driven Software Engineer with 1.5 years of experience in software development, web technologies, and programming languages including Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, and C++. My professional journey has been enriched through hands-on work in PACS automation, DICOM migration, and full-stack development using React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.

I enjoy building creative, user-friendly, and functional applications, especially using the MERN stack and modern tools like Vite, React, and GitHub for version control and deployment. My curiosity spans multiple domains, including cloud computing, REST API design, and database management. My adaptability, attention to detail, and eagerness to learn make me well-suited for collaborative projects and fast-paced technical environments.

Whether itâ€™s debugging complex code, designing intuitive UI, or exploring new technologies like AI and IoT, I approach each task with enthusiasm and a growth mindset. I am currently seeking opportunities to sharpen my full-stack development skills and contribute meaningfully to impactful projects.
