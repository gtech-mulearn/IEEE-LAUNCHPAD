# Devananda S J

## About Me

Hi, I’m Devananda SJ, an 2nd yr ECE student at SCTCE TVM who’s always curious about how tech can shape the world around us. 
My interests stretch beyond the screen — into the embedded systems and IoT world, where software meets hardware, and into the realm of cybersecurity, where every vulnerability is a puzzle waiting to be solved.
Whether it’s building interactive web apps or tinkering with microcontrollers, I thrive at the intersection of creativity and logic. 
I believe that real innovation comes from collaboration — not competition.
That’s why I value friends who share not just skills but sincerity, curiosity, and a desire to build something real in this noisy world. 
For me, technology is a tool to understand the world better, not escape it.
I’m here to learn continuously, share what I know, and contribute to building a smarter, more connected, and secure future.

-  As the Tech Sublead of the µLearn SCT chapter and an active member of the IEEE SCT chapter,
-  I’ve had the opportunity to grow not just as a learner, but as a leader who supports and uplifts others in their tech journey.
-  Through organizing and participating in bootcamps, workshops, and community events, I’ve learned the value of collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and staying curious.
-  I believe true leadership isn’t about titles — it’s about creating spaces where people feel inspired to learn, build, and push boundaries together.

#### Networking:

 I excel in networking by building genuine connections and engaging actively in community events. I plan to influence and lead by sharing insights, collaborating on projects, and fostering mutual growth. By being approachable and supportive,
 I will inspire others and strengthen our professional network.

#### Career Plan:

 mmediate Career Plans My immediate goal is to deepen my technical expertise in areas like web development, cybersecurity, and embedded systems, so I can contribute meaningfully to real-world projects and become a valuable asset to forward-thinking tech companies. I'm actively engaging in upskilling through hands-on bootcamps, workshops, and community-led initiatives, with a focus on building practical, problem-solving skills.
 I aim to bridge the gap between learning and application, and step into roles where I can create secure, efficient, and user-centered technology solutions.
#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

 Kerala’s tech ecosystem is evolving into a vibrant, inclusive space that nurtures innovation and young talent. Initiatives like the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM) have played a pivotal role in creating a strong foundation for startups by offering mentorship, funding, and infrastructure support. At the same time, community-driven platforms like GTech µLearn are bridging the skill gap by encouraging peer-to-peer learning, upskilling, and collaboration among students across the state. With academic institutions, tech communities, and government initiatives working hand in hand, 
 Kerala is steadily becoming a hub where curiosity meets opportunity, empowering the next generation of technologists and changemakers.
