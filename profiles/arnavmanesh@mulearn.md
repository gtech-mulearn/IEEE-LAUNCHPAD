#### Leadership and Influence:

I lead peer learning sessions in my college club and actively assist juniors with project guidance. Through the µLearn community, I’ve taken initiative in group challenges, providing guidance and building documentation that others refer to. I regularly assist on Discord tech channels.

#### Networking:

I engage in several Discord and GitHub-based tech communities. I plan to expand networking by contributing more consistently to open-source and mentoring new contributors. My goal is to inspire others by creating starter-friendly issues and project guides, encouraging collaboration.

#### Career Plan:

In the short term, I aim to build strong foundational projects and gain internships in full-stack or mobile development. Long term, I envision building developer-friendly tools/startups that solve real community problems, while mentoring others in the Kerala Startup Ecosystem through forums and local meetups.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

Kerala has talent and creativity but needs stronger startup exposure and mentorship ecosystems. With platforms like µLearn and community-driven spaces, Kerala can become a hub for young innovators. More support for open-source and early-stage projects will spark the next generation of startup founders.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:
