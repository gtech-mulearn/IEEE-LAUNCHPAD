#### Leadership and Influence:

I've often taken the lead on designing, building, and deploying full-stack applications from the ground up. I have served as the IEEE Chair of my Student branch , College of Engineering Kottarakkara. This role has provided me insights on how to become a good influence.My project direction, technical depth, and security-focused thinking have influenced my peers to adopt more privacy-conscious practices.

#### Networking:

I actively engage in communities on platforms like GitHub, Discord, and LinkedIn. I enjoy collaborating on open-source issues and helping fellow developers with MERN and Java.I would love to attend more sessions to connect and network with peers.

#### Career Plan:

Short-term: Contribute to local Kerala-based startup incubators and tech hubs by building scalable MVPs.

Long-term: Launch or co-found a startup focused on privacy-first SaaS tools, and work towards building Kerala into a cyber-tech hub that supports and fosters open innovation.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

Kerala has a highly talented developer base and a strong culture of learning. To become a thriving startup hub, it should focus more on product thinking, foster early-stage investment, and encourage deep-tech exploration like AI, cybersecurity. Strong community-led innovation and support from government incubators will help elevate the ecosystem.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

I have contributed to several personal and collaborative projects on GitHub. Some repositories are open-sourced.Iâ€™ve also helped debug and refactor issues in open-source Node.js and React libraries. Contributions include improving authentication flows, fixing MongoDB query issues, and enhancing file upload handling.

#### History of Community Engagement:

I actively help other developers on platforms like Stack Overflow, Discord (developer and cybersecurity servers), and Reddit communities related to web development, cybersecurity, and programming. I've also created educational content explaining Java fundamentals, backend architecture. Mainly on Reddit.
