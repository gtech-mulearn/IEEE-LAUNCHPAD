### About Me

> ### About Me

> I am a Computer Science undergraduate from Government Engineering College Idukki (2021–2025) with a passion for full-stack development and mobile UI design. Skilled in React, React Native, Django, and Firebase, I’ve worked on real-world projects including financial platforms and bidding systems. I’ve completed a **virtual AI internship at IBM SkillsBuild** and participated in the **IITM Pravartak virtual fellowship**, gaining research-oriented exposure and technical training. I'm committed to building meaningful solutions, learning continuously, and contributing to the Kerala startup ecosystem through innovation and collaboration.

#### Leadership and Influence:

- As an NSS Volunteer at GECI, I organized community-based programs like health camps and awareness drives, developing my leadership and coordination skills. I also took initiative in my IITM Pravartak fellowship, leading discussions and guiding teammates during collaborative tasks.

#### Networking:

- I actively participate in technical communities on Discord and during internships. I network with developers and mentors through GitHub, LinkedIn, and hackathons. I plan to grow Kerala’s tech ecosystem by mentoring juniors, organizing workshops, and promoting tech collaboration in student circles.

#### Career Plan:

- My immediate goal is to join a software development team where I can grow as a full-stack developer. Long-term, I aim to support Kerala’s startup ecosystem by contributing open-source tools, mentoring developers, and collaborating with early-stage startups to bring innovative ideas to life.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala has a vibrant pool of talent and growing infrastructure. To take it to the next level, we need more support for student-led startups, stronger tech communities, and incentives for innovation and research-based development. Encouraging early collaboration and mentorship will also play a key role.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

- I have contributed original projects on GitHub like EstateEase, FolioX, and Farmers Portal. These are publicly available, well-documented, and follow clean coding practices. I aim to contribute to wider open-source ecosystems in the coming months.

#### History of Community Engagement:

- I have engaged in technical forums, project teams during fellowships (IITM Pravartak, IBM), and Discord developer communities. I’ve helped peers debug code and improve project architecture during group-based challenges and coursework.

#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

- Currently working on improving GitHub README documentation and plan to publish blog posts on Dev.to and Hashnode. I also document my coding process in project wikis and share learnings with peers during study groups.

#### Highly Used Software Tools:

- While still growing, my apps like FolioX and EstateEase are designed with scalable, reusable components and are intended to be expanded into widely usable tools in the near future.
