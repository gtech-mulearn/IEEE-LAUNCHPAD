##  About Me  
I’m a passionate and curious second-year Electronics and Communication Engineering student at Mar Baselios College of Engineering and Technology.  
My core interests lie in **Communication Systems, Signal Processing, and Embedded Systems & IoT**.  
I enjoy hands-on learning and thrive in collaborative environments — whether it's through building impactful tech, working with student communities, or taking on real-world challenges in hackathons.  
I believe meaningful engineering is where **logic meets empathy**.  
Outside of tech, I love exploring **digital illustration** and diving into **science fiction**.

##  Career Plan

- I aim to explore how **low-power AI** can be deployed on microcontrollers (like ESP32, STM32) for real-time decision-making in **health, agriculture, and energy applications**.  
  Build a startup in embedded health tech in Kerala, focusing on affordable, sensor-based solutions for rural communities and schools. Promote sustainable and scalable electronics solutions for local challenges.

- I plan to actively participate in national and state-level **hackathons and design challenges**  
  (e.g., **Smart India Hackathon**, **IEEE Maker Fair**) that emphasize **problem-solving using embedded systems**, especially in **healthcare and sustainability**.

- My solutions will be designed with **cost, power efficiency, and usability** in mind, ensuring that they are both **scalable and suitable for the Indian context** — especially in **public schools and primary health centers**.

## Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem

- Kerala’s unique blend of **talent, community spirit, and educational reach** makes it a fertile ground for **hardware-software hybrid innovation**.  
  With more **hardware labs, tech-focused incubators, and cross-discipline collaboration**, Kerala can rise as a leader in **student-led embedded innovations with global relevance**.

- Targeting sectors such as **sustainability, healthcare, and tourism technology** will pave the way for **impactful solutions** that resonate on a global scale.  
  With the right backing, **Kerala has the potential to become a significant force in India's startup ecosystem**.

##  History of Open Source Contributions

- Contributed to:
  - **EcoWatt** – a sustainability-focused web platform I co-developed to promote **energy conservation and awareness**.  
    The project provides users with easy access to electricity-related resources, tips for reducing power consumption, and **interactive features to encourage responsible energy use**.

---

##  History of Community Engagement

- I actively engage with the tech community through platforms like **Discord servers, GitHub discussions**, and **student forums**, where I share knowledge, provide peer support, and collaborate on projects.

- Being part of a community reminds me that **you don't have to wait to become an expert to make an impact** — you just have to be willing to **build, share, and learn openly**.
