#### Leadership and Influence:

I serve as the UiPath Execom Content Team Head. In addition, my role as NSS Poster Team Head involved designing campaigns for social impact, showing leadership through creative direction and collaboration. I’ve led and managed technical teams in college projects, guided peers in UI/UX tasks, and contributed significantly to hackathons and innovation challenges.

#### Networking:

I actively engage with the developer community through platforms like GitHub, LinkedIn, and µLearn. I’ve participated in bootcamps, webinars, and technical events, collaborating with fellow students and professionals. By consistently sharing, learning, and contributing, I aim to be a positive influence in student tech circles and mentor others on their journey.

#### Career Plan:

I plan to contribute to Kerala-based startups focused on digital platforms and user experience.
In the long term, I aspire to launch my own tech product or startup that combines accessibility, automation, and personalization — especially in the education or career development space. 
I also aim to guide student developers through mentorship programs and community learning spaces.



#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

Kerala’s ecosystem is growing fast, and to truly thrive, we need better integration between academia and the startup world. By investing in practical student innovation, creating more student-founder accelerator programs, and leveraging communities like TinkerHub and µLearn, Kerala can become a key startup powerhouse. Encouraging young innovators with funding and showcasing platforms will accelerate the ecosystem.
