### About Me

> I'm an Embedded Systems and IoT Developer with a strong foundation in `C`, `Embedded C`, and `Microcontroller Programming`. I have hands-on experience in building real-time automation systems using GSM modules, Quectel’s OpenCPU SDK, and Raspberry Pi. Currently, I'm working at NEST as an Assembly Operator while pursuing an Embedded Systems course at Keltron Knowledge Centre.

#### Career Plan:

- As a passionate Electronics and Embedded Systems enthusiast, my short-term goal is to join a company or R&D team where I can apply my skills in microcontroller programming, hardware interfacing, and real-time embedded development. I'm especially interested in working on IoT devices, industrial automation systems, or consumer electronics products that bridge physical hardware with smart logic.

- In the medium term, I aim to:
- Strengthen my command over real-time OS, communication protocols (UART, SPI, I2C, MQTT), and secure embedded design.
- Contribute to end-to-end product development—from hardware setup and firmware programming to deployment and debugging.
- Earn professional certifications in Embedded C, FreeRTOS, and Python for Embedded Applications.

- In the long term,I envision myself in a lead Embedded Engineer or IoT System Architect role, leading product teams and mentoring junior engineers. I also aim to contribute to open-source projects or publish design guides to help other young engineers enter the field. Eventually, I aspire to launch my own embedded solutions startup focusing on agritech, healthcare, or sustainable automation products.


#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

-Kerala’s tech ecosystem is evolving rapidly, supported by strong government initiatives like KDISC, IEDC, KSUM, and programs such as μLearn, YIP, and RINK. The state has successfully created a fertile ground for innovation through hackathons, startup grants, and grassroots technology awareness. 
-With the rise of community-led platforms and access to global resources, students and professionals alike are more empowered to build, collaborate, and contribute.
-However, there's still a gap between academic training and industry-ready skills. Addressing this with practical exposure, internships, and industry-academia collaborations can unlock Kerala’s full potential. 
-As someone actively involved in team projects, μLearn learning circles, and startup-oriented competitions, I believe Kerala has the capability to become a significant hub for embedded systems, AI, and sustainable tech—especially if more support is given to hardware innovation alongside software.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:
-As an embedded systems enthusiast, I began exploring open-source contributions through collaborative GitHub repositories, especially within μLearn and student-led communities. 
-I’m still in the early stages of active open-source involvement, I regularly engage with repositories to learn best practices and understand version control workflows (Git, GitHub).

#### History of Community Engagement:

-I have actively participated in several tech and innovation communities throughout my academic journey. As an IEDC (Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Cell) student lead, I organized and supported multiple workshops and idea challenges that promoted innovation and peer learning.
-I was also a Young Innovators Program (YIP) Finalist, where our team presented real-world solutions through collaborative research and prototyping.
-At μLearn, I joined the community to stay connected with like-minded peers, improve my skill set, and contribute wherever possible. 
-Working on team projects such as SmartBin, Smart Parking, and Plant Doctor has deepened my appreciation for teamwork, peer-led learning, and knowledge sharing. 


#### Highly Used Software Tools:

I have worked with development tools and platforms such as Quectel OpenCPU SDK, Arduino IDE, VS Code, IDLE Python, Python (Jupyter/Colab), Tinkercad, and Eclipse IDE.
I have also worked with designing tools like Canva , Figma
