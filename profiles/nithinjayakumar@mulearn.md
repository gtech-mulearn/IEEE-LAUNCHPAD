### About Me

> Hi, I'm Nithin jayakumar, first year computer science student at college of engineering chengannur . I am new to this computer field i have 
no experience with computer till 12th standard . But i started to study computer sceince coding since i started my btech journey Basically i 
started with language C . I think it was a nice choice to learn C as my first programming language i am constanly learning about the language 
not i leaned everything but understood the most of the concepts . Also i have some basic mySQL knowledge . Now i am learning HTML,CSS and JS 
to try the field of webdev its little but difficult to me but i will surely acheive it and to experince the vast field of computerscience

help from them they are ready to help us also i want to network with forums in our college i will activley try to do that

#### Career Plan:

- I have a slight interest in Data science carrer so i wanted to learn the advanced python machine learning and want to become a Data science engineer
also i will be looking for software engineer basically i reaaly dont know the vast feild name as i am learning all these things

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala's tech ecosystem is rapidly expanding, driven by government support, educational excellence, and a thriving startup scene. 
With a focus on innovation and entrepreneurship, the state is becoming a hub for tech talent and emerging startups, particularly in 
sectors like healthcare and education technology. Continued investment and collaboration are crucial for its global competitiveness.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

- since now no open source contribution


#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

- not created such things but i am eagerly trying to create a one

#### Highly Used Software Tools:

- Mainly i doesnt use till now but i will be using in my recent days i will learn how to use them

#### Competitive Website Profiles:

- HackerRank - https://www.hackerrank.com/profile/nithinbro1010
