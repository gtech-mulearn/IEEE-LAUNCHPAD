## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a curious tinkerer and builder, working with both software and hardware (when I know what I’m doing) to solve problems I face — or simply for fun.  

I stay up to date with the latest trends in the tech world while deepening my knowledge in all areas of software development, which remains my main focus.  

There are many things I don’t know yet, but when I face something new, the official documentation of that technology or software is always my go-to guide.  

My ultimate goal is to gain knowledge to the point where I can create anything I imagine — whether it’s setting up a homelab on old PCs or experimenting with the latest AI-powered tools like video generation. I also love spreading tech knowledge in fun and engaging ways through communities.  

Currently, my focus is on **writing clean, readable, and easily understandable code** that others can work with seamlessly.
