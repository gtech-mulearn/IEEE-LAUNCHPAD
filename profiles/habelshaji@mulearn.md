### About Me

I’m a detail-driven Computer Science and Engineering graduate with a sharp focus on building scalable, real-world tech systems — from full-stack web apps to AI-powered voice assistants. My strength lies in engineering systems that are fast, accurate, and purpose-built, especially in challenging environments like voice-based automation, real-time transcription, and community-first microlearning platforms.

My portfolio includes mission-critical systems like **Learn Quest**, a micro-learning platform built with dynamic APIs (Gemini, YouTube, GitHub, SERP), and **Zentry**, a low-latency AI assistant for admission reception, optimized for offline use with blazing-fast **RAG + Phi-3** architecture. I'm also deeply involved in **telephony automation** using **Asterisk**, **PJSIP**, and Python AGI scripting.

I prefer working from the terminal, solving high-impact problems with clean backend-first logic. I enjoy pushing limits—whether tuning a **Whisper-medium Malayalam STT** model for noisy phone calls, fine-tuning AI pipelines, or managing full-stack apps using **Firebase**, **React**, and **Flutter**. I'm driven by performance, clarity, and control — and I build for real users, not demos.
