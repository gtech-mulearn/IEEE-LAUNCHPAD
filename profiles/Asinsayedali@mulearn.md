### About Me

I’m a final-year Computer Science student at the College of Engineering Perumon, with a strong foundation in AI and backend development. My journey has involved building and deploying real-world applications using Python, Django, and AWS services like Cognito, DynamoDB, SES, and CodePipeline.

Through roles like AI Intern at Sixtysix Technologies and freelance developer, I’ve worked with voice agents, interview bots using LLMs, and scalable cloud-based platforms. I’ve also taken on significant leadership roles, founding my college’s first GDG On Campus chapter and leading the BEWEB.dev state-wide full-stack program under Gtech Mulearn.

Whether it’s crafting AI workflows, or building community-driven tools, I approach every project with a strong sense of purpose and a commitment to impact. I'm currently looking to deepen my technical skills and contribute meaningfully to projects that leverage AI and automation.
