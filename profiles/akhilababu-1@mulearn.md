### About Me
I'm an Engineering graduate with a strong passion for coding and development. Recently, I completed a full stack Java internship at Kodnest Technologies, where I acquired practical skills in Java, MySQL, frontend technologies, and manual testing. During my internship, I contributed to real-world projects and learned directly from industry professionals, enhancing my hands-on experience.
 I am a certified full stack Java developer. My interest in Spring Boot technologies has driven me to delve deeper into building robust and scalable applications. I am eager to continue expanding my expertise in this area and look forward to leveraging Spring Boot to develop efficient, high-performing backend solutions.
