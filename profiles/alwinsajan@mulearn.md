### About Me

I’m a Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate at Toc H Institute of Science & Technology with a deep passion for both Web Development and Applied AI. My journey has taken me through crafting responsive frontend experiences using React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion — to building intelligent applications powered by LLM APIs (Gemini, OpenAI) and RAG pipelines.

As a core contributor and Research Lead at Core.AI, I actively mentor peers, organize workshops, and explore the practical intersection of AI, web, and automation. I’ve built impactful projects like **Docify-RAG** — a document-aware chatbot using Gemini and RAG, and a real-time **Smart Waste Detection System** powered by YOLOv11.

I'm well-versed in full-stack development with React, Flask, and Next.js, and I enjoy integrating APIs, optimizing UX, and deploying production-ready apps. My foundation also extends into ML tools like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and LangChain — always driven by curiosity and the pursuit of meaningful tech.

Whether it’s clean code, AI-powered chat interfaces, or responsive web design, I approach every project with innovation, clarity, and a love for problem-solving.
